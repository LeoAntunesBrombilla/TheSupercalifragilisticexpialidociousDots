TO-DO:

    + show pwd (k)
    + prompt (n)
        +,i starship's prompt
    + exit status checking
        d: change color and symbol
    + current git branch (buggy)
    + username and hostname when connecter
    + show username and hostname when connecter via ssh
    + name main func __init
    + configure directory shown by shell on top (look at starship documentation > advanced configuration > set window title)

ANNOTATIONS:

    + what makes is blink/take too long, is the fact that it's checking
        for the github branch
    + what made xelabash so slow, was that the fact that it showed the github branch
        . All in all, all i had to do was to comment out every line in the code
        that showed the github branch or said `git` somewhere
    + using the conventional $(__git_ps1) command to get current branch
        is laggy, so use the func then from
