Basically, the idea is to create a repository with my dotfiles that I can clone to a new machine and use an "install.sh" script to
install all the "dependencies" and packages that I want. Basically just configuring the the system for myself based off of config file (.<file> #most of the time)

This is a little project idea for my dotfile repo:

TO-DO:
    + Releard GitHub basics
    + Rewatch dotfiles repo
    + Analyze which parts of the projects must be done
        +,i README.md -- how to use install.sh
        +,i .dotfiles in matter
        +,i installed_packages.txt
        +,i install.sh
            +,j install each package one by one
            +,j confugure corresponsing packages (e.g. luaver)
            +,j make list of installed packages to update current installed_packages.txt
            +,j install and sync current bin
        +,i refresh.sh
        +,i my_bin/ -- my /usr/local/bin #files to be moved basically
    + order of execution
        +,1 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
        +,2 install packages from installed_packages.txt
            +,i configure each individual thing
                +,1 luaver, for example
        +,3 mv (cp(?)) .dotfiles to their corresponding locations
            +,i dotfiles to be sited:
        +,4 refresh.sh -- to finish install
    + add ability to install listed ppa packages

Notes:
    + createa a semi link using: `ln -s <full_original_name_path> <path_to_it_if_wanted/semylink>`
