Description:

Basically, the idea is to create a repository with my dotfiles that I can clone to a new machine and use an "install.sh" script to
install all the "dependencies" and packages that I want. Basically just configuring the the system for myself based off of config file (.<file> #most of the time)

This is a little project idea for my dotfile repo:

Basic .dotfiles strucure:

    1. install.sh                                       (1/2)
    2. install pkgs (e.g. from apt-get)                 (yes)
    3. add main-stream repos for the OS                 (yes)
    4. configure shortcuts (e.g. for gnome)             (no)
    5. install drivers                                  (yes)
    6. update and upgrade                               (no)
    7. bin symlinks                                     (yes)
    8. install and configure terminal                   (no)
    9. install extensions                               (no)
    10. install external apps                           (no)
        + google-chrome
        + mysql workbench
        + tlauncher
        + kvm
    11. install external stuff                          (yes)
        + lua
            +,i luaver
        + java
            +,i jvm
            +,i jre
        + python
        + nodejs                                        (no)
    12. configure theme, cursor, appearance, shell      (no)
    14. configure wallpaper                             (yes)
    15. install term_fonts                              (no)
    16. a UI                                            (yes)
    17. add all PPA repositories from a .txt file       (yes)
    18. install noti                                    (yes)
    19. generate apt-manual  list                       (yes)
    17. install all                                     (no)

In order of execution:



TO-DO:
    + Releard GitHub basics
    + Rewatch dotfiles repo
    + Analyze which parts of the projects must be done
        +,i README.md -- how to use install.sh
        +,i .dotfiles in matter
        +,i installed_packages.txt
        +,i install.sh
            +,j install each package one by one
            +,j configure corresponding packages (e.g. luaver)
            +,j make list of installed packages to update current installed_packages.txt
            +,j install and sync current bin
        +,i refresh.sh
        +,i my_bin/ -- my /usr/local/bin #files to be moved basically
    + order of execution
        +,1 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
        +,2 install packages from installed_packages.txt
            +,i configure each individual thing
                +,1 luaver, for example
        +,3 mv (cp(?)) .dotfiles to their corresponding locations
            +,i dotfiles to be sited:
        +,4 refresh.sh -- to finish install
    + add ability to install listed ppa packages

Notes:
    + createa a semi link using: `ln -s <full_original_name_path> <path_to_it_if_wanted/semylink>`
